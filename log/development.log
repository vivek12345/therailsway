What happens when you enter a URL in adressbar?

<br/>

This is what exactly happens

<img src=''/webserver.jpg''/>

1)When we enter a URL in addressbar, Web Browser sends a DNS query request to DNS server for domain to IP resolution.

 Suppose a user enters rollege.com in adressbar. Browser will send a query request to the DNS server ,to get the IP address of the server where the website is hosted.

2) In return to the query request, DNS server replies with the IP address of the website. 

3) After getting the IP address the browser genterates a HTTP request. This HTTP request contains the resource location(web pages,images,video) that the user wants to access from the server. This requests are automatically generated and send to the server by the browser. In the above image request to get index.php page is made to the server.

 This requests can be viewed using applications such as wireshark or fiddler.

4) In response to the HTTP request, web server respond with HTTP response message. Response message contains the requested resources.

5) Browser catch this response(HTML,CSS,javascript, images) and formulate it in the browser.

In fidler, use raw view to view both header and body(content) of a request.

<img src=''/fidler.jpg''/>

Generating a HTTP request manually through telnet

1> Open command prompt
 start > run > cmd

2> Enter the command
 telnet www.rollege.com 80
The command connect you to the server on which rollege.com is hosted. As the server is Web server connection is made on port no 80	

NOTE:
By default, telnet is not activated in Windows 7. To activate telnet follow the process.

3> Creating a HTTP request

HTTP request Header
 GET /index.php HTTP/1.1
Host: www.rollege.com
Copy paste the request in the telnet session.
NOTE:
In windows telnet client, you will not able to see what you type. Cut paste the request and press enter 2 times.

GET method is used for requesting a web page. Other methods than can be used are POST and HEAD.

POST is used when user has to submits a form. Where as HEAD method ask server only to return the response header. 

The path is the part of the URL after the host name. This path is also called the request Uniform Resource Identifier (URI).

HTTP/1.1 is the HTTP version.

5> HTTP response
HTTP response Header
If the HTTP request is sent corectly you will get HTTP response something like this
 HTTP/1.1 200 OK

What happens when you enter a URL in adressbar?

<br/>

This is what exactly happens

<img src=''/webserver.jpg''/>

1)When we enter a URL in addressbar, Web Browser sends a DNS query request to DNS server for domain to IP resolution.

 Suppose a user enters rollege.com in adressbar. Browser will send a query request to the DNS server ,to get the IP address of the server where the website is hosted.

2) In return to the query request, DNS server replies with the IP address of the website. 

3) After getting the IP address the browser genterates a HTTP request. This HTTP request contains the resource location(web pages,images,video) that the user wants to access from the server. This requests are automatically generated and send to the server by the browser. In the above image request to get index.php page is made to the server.

 This requests can be viewed using applications such as wireshark or fiddler.

4) In response to the HTTP request, web server respond with HTTP response message. Response message contains the requested resources.

5) Browser catch this response(HTML,CSS,javascript, images) and formulate it in the browser.

In fidler, use raw view to view both header and body(content) of a request.

<img src=''/fidler.jpg''/>

Generating a HTTP request manually through telnet

1> Open command prompt
 start > run > cmd

2> Enter the command
 telnet www.rollege.com 80
The command connect you to the server on which rollege.com is hosted. As the server is Web server connection is made on port no 80	

NOTE:
By default, telnet is not activated in Windows 7. To activate telnet follow the process.

3> Creating a HTTP request

HTTP request Header
 GET /index.php HTTP/1.1
Host: www.rollege.com
Copy paste the request in the telnet session.
NOTE:
In windows telnet client, you will not able to see what you type. Cut paste the request and press enter 2 times.

GET method is used for requesting a web page. Other methods than can be used are POST and HEAD.

POST is used when user has to submits a form. Where as HEAD method ask server only to return the response header. 

The path is the part of the URL after the host name. This path is also called the request Uniform Resource Identifier (URI).

HTTP/1.1 is the HTTP version.

5> HTTP response
HTTP response Header
If the HTTP request is sent corectly you will get HTTP response something like this
 HTTP/1.1 200 OK

Nesting divs within containers is a very easy concept, yet it’s also easy to overlook.
 Just remember; when beginning a new area that will contain subsequent divs, you will need to use a row to ensure proper alignment. The use of rows provides for a rather brilliant alternative to the standard practice of using “Alpha” and “Omega” classes when designing within a grid.
I am using simple_format(@company.description) to make a text into a number of paragraphs. On one page I only want to show, lets say, the first three paragraphs. Is there any nifty ruby method that can help out here or should I read up on my regular expression skills, which are very out of date.

What happens when you enter a URL in adressbar?

<br/>

This is what exactly happens

<img src=''/webserver.jpg''/>

1)When we enter a URL in addressbar, Web Browser sends a DNS query request to DNS server for domain to IP resolution.

 Suppose a user enters rollege.com in adressbar. Browser will send a query request to the DNS server ,to get the IP address of the server where the website is hosted.

2) In return to the query request, DNS server replies with the IP address of the website. 

3) After getting the IP address the browser genterates a HTTP request. This HTTP request contains the resource location(web pages,images,video) that the user wants to access from the server. This requests are automatically generated and send to the server by the browser. In the above image request to get index.php page is made to the server.

 This requests can be viewed using applications such as wireshark or fiddler.

4) In response to the HTTP request, web server respond with HTTP response message. Response message contains the requested resources.

5) Browser catch this response(HTML,CSS,javascript, images) and formulate it in the browser.

In fidler, use raw view to view both header and body(content) of a request.

<img src=''/fidler.jpg''/>

Generating a HTTP request manually through telnet

1> Open command prompt
 start > run > cmd

2> Enter the command
 telnet www.rollege.com 80
The command connect you to the server on which rollege.com is hosted. As the server is Web server connection is made on port no 80	

NOTE:
By default, telnet is not activated in Windows 7. To activate telnet follow the process.

3> Creating a HTTP request

HTTP request Header
 GET /index.php HTTP/1.1
Host: www.rollege.com
Copy paste the request in the telnet session.
NOTE:
In windows telnet client, you will not able to see what you type. Cut paste the request and press enter 2 times.

GET method is used for requesting a web page. Other methods than can be used are POST and HEAD.

POST is used when user has to submits a form. Where as HEAD method ask server only to return the response header. 

The path is the part of the URL after the host name. This path is also called the request Uniform Resource Identifier (URI).

HTTP/1.1 is the HTTP version.

5> HTTP response
HTTP response Header
If the HTTP request is sent corectly you will get HTTP response something like this
 HTTP/1.1 200 OK

What happens when you enter a URL in adressbar?

<br/>

This is what exactly happens

<img src=''/webserver.jpg''/>

1)When we enter a URL in addressbar, Web Browser sends a DNS query request to DNS server for domain to IP resolution.

 Suppose a user enters rollege.com in adressbar. Browser will send a query request to the DNS server ,to get the IP address of the server where the website is hosted.

2) In return to the query request, DNS server replies with the IP address of the website. 

3) After getting the IP address the browser genterates a HTTP request. This HTTP request contains the resource location(web pages,images,video) that the user wants to access from the server. This requests are automatically generated and send to the server by the browser. In the above image request to get index.php page is made to the server.

 This requests can be viewed using applications such as wireshark or fiddler.

4) In response to the HTTP request, web server respond with HTTP response message. Response message contains the requested resources.

5) Browser catch this response(HTML,CSS,javascript, images) and formulate it in the browser.

In fidler, use raw view to view both header and body(content) of a request.

<img src=''/fidler.jpg''/>

Generating a HTTP request manually through telnet

1> Open command prompt
 start > run > cmd

2> Enter the command
 telnet www.rollege.com 80
The command connect you to the server on which rollege.com is hosted. As the server is Web server connection is made on port no 80	

NOTE:
By default, telnet is not activated in Windows 7. To activate telnet follow the process.

3> Creating a HTTP request

HTTP request Header
 GET /index.php HTTP/1.1
Host: www.rollege.com
Copy paste the request in the telnet session.
NOTE:
In windows telnet client, you will not able to see what you type. Cut paste the request and press enter 2 times.

GET method is used for requesting a web page. Other methods than can be used are POST and HEAD.

POST is used when user has to submits a form. Where as HEAD method ask server only to return the response header. 

The path is the part of the URL after the host name. This path is also called the request Uniform Resource Identifier (URI).

HTTP/1.1 is the HTTP version.

5> HTTP response
HTTP response Header
If the HTTP request is sent corectly you will get HTTP response something like this
 HTTP/1.1 200 OK

3) After getting the IP address the browser genterates a HTTP request. This HTTP request contains the resource location(web pages,images,video) that the user wants to access from the server. This requests are automatically generated and send to the server by the browser. In the above image request to get index.php page is made to the server.

 This requests can be viewed using applications such as wireshark or fiddler.

4) In response to the HTTP request, web server respond with HTTP response message. Response message contains the requested resources.

5) Browser catch this response(HTML,CSS,javascript, images) and formulate it in the browser.

In fidler, use raw view to view both header and body(content) of a request.

Copy paste the request in the telnet session.
NOTE:
In windows telnet client, you will not able to see what you type. Cut paste the request and press enter 2 times.

GET method is used for requesting a web page. Other methods than can be used are POST and HEAD.

POST is used when user has to submits a form. Where as HEAD method ask server only to return the response header. 

The path is the part of the URL after the host name. This path is also called the request Uniform Resource Identifier (URI).

HTTP/1.1 is the HTTP version.

What happens when you enter a URL in adressbar?

<br/>

This is what exactly happens

<img src=''/webserver.jpg''/>

1)When we enter a URL in addressbar, Web Browser sends a DNS query request to DNS server for domain to IP resolution.

 Suppose a user enters rollege.com in adressbar. Browser will send a query request to the DNS server ,to get the IP address of the server where the website is hosted.

2) In return to the query request, DNS server replies with the IP address of the website. 

3) After getting the IP address the browser genterates a HTTP request. This HTTP request contains the resource location(web pages,images,video) that the user wants to access from the server. This requests are automatically generated and send to the server by the browser. In the above image request to get index.php page is made to the server.

 This requests can be viewed using applications such as wireshark or fiddler.

4) In response to the HTTP request, web server respond with HTTP response message. Response message contains the requested resources.

5) Browser catch this response(HTML,CSS,javascript, images) and formulate it in the browser.

In fidler, use raw view to view both header and body(content) of a request.

<img src=''/fidler.jpg''/>

Generating a HTTP request manually through telnet

1> Open command prompt
 start > run > cmd

2> Enter the command
 telnet www.rollege.com 80
The command connect you to the server on which rollege.com is hosted. As the server is Web server connection is made on port no 80	

NOTE:
By default, telnet is not activated in Windows 7. To activate telnet follow the process.

3> Creating a HTTP request

HTTP request Header
 GET /index.php HTTP/1.1
Host: www.rollege.com
Copy paste the request in the telnet session.
NOTE:
In windows telnet client, you will not able to see what you type. Cut paste the request and press enter 2 times.

GET method is used for requesting a web page. Other methods than can be used are POST and HEAD.

POST is used when user has to submits a form. Where as HEAD method ask server only to return the response header. 

The path is the part of the URL after the host name. This path is also called the request Uniform Resource Identifier (URI).

HTTP/1.1 is the HTTP version.

5> HTTP response
HTTP response Header
If the HTTP request is sent corectly you will get HTTP response something like this
 HTTP/1.1 200 OK

Nesting divs within containers is a very easy concept, yet it’s also easy to overlook.
 Just remember; when beginning a new area that will contain subsequent divs, you will need to use a row to ensure proper alignment. The use of rows provides for a rather brilliant alternative to the standard practice of using “Alpha” and “Omega” classes when designing within a grid.
I am using simple_format(@company.description) to make a text into a number of paragraphs. On one page I only want to show, lets say, the first three paragraphs. Is there any nifty ruby method that can help out here or should I read up on my regular expression skills, which are very out of date.
