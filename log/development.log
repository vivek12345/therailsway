What happens when you enter a URL in adressbar?

<br/>

This is what exactly happens

<img src=''/webserver.jpg''/>

1)When we enter a URL in addressbar, Web Browser sends a DNS query request to DNS server for domain to IP resolution.

 Suppose a user enters rollege.com in adressbar. Browser will send a query request to the DNS server ,to get the IP address of the server where the website is hosted.

2) In return to the query request, DNS server replies with the IP address of the website. 

3) After getting the IP address the browser genterates a HTTP request. This HTTP request contains the resource location(web pages,images,video) that the user wants to access from the server. This requests are automatically generated and send to the server by the browser. In the above image request to get index.php page is made to the server.

 This requests can be viewed using applications such as wireshark or fiddler.

4) In response to the HTTP request, web server respond with HTTP response message. Response message contains the requested resources.

5) Browser catch this response(HTML,CSS,javascript, images) and formulate it in the browser.

In fidler, use raw view to view both header and body(content) of a request.

<img src=''/fidler.jpg''/>

Generating a HTTP request manually through telnet

1> Open command prompt
 start > run > cmd

2> Enter the command
 telnet www.rollege.com 80
The command connect you to the server on which rollege.com is hosted. As the server is Web server connection is made on port no 80	

NOTE:
By default, telnet is not activated in Windows 7. To activate telnet follow the process.

3> Creating a HTTP request

HTTP request Header
 GET /index.php HTTP/1.1
Host: www.rollege.com
Copy paste the request in the telnet session.
NOTE:
In windows telnet client, you will not able to see what you type. Cut paste the request and press enter 2 times.

GET method is used for requesting a web page. Other methods than can be used are POST and HEAD.

POST is used when user has to submits a form. Where as HEAD method ask server only to return the response header. 

The path is the part of the URL after the host name. This path is also called the request Uniform Resource Identifier (URI).

HTTP/1.1 is the HTTP version.

5> HTTP response
HTTP response Header
If the HTTP request is sent corectly you will get HTTP response something like this
 HTTP/1.1 200 OK

What happens when you enter a URL in adressbar?

<br/>

This is what exactly happens

<img src=''/webserver.jpg''/>

1)When we enter a URL in addressbar, Web Browser sends a DNS query request to DNS server for domain to IP resolution.

 Suppose a user enters rollege.com in adressbar. Browser will send a query request to the DNS server ,to get the IP address of the server where the website is hosted.

2) In return to the query request, DNS server replies with the IP address of the website. 

3) After getting the IP address the browser genterates a HTTP request. This HTTP request contains the resource location(web pages,images,video) that the user wants to access from the server. This requests are automatically generated and send to the server by the browser. In the above image request to get index.php page is made to the server.

 This requests can be viewed using applications such as wireshark or fiddler.

4) In response to the HTTP request, web server respond with HTTP response message. Response message contains the requested resources.

5) Browser catch this response(HTML,CSS,javascript, images) and formulate it in the browser.

In fidler, use raw view to view both header and body(content) of a request.

<img src=''/fidler.jpg''/>

Generating a HTTP request manually through telnet

1> Open command prompt
 start > run > cmd

2> Enter the command
 telnet www.rollege.com 80
The command connect you to the server on which rollege.com is hosted. As the server is Web server connection is made on port no 80	

NOTE:
By default, telnet is not activated in Windows 7. To activate telnet follow the process.

3> Creating a HTTP request

HTTP request Header
 GET /index.php HTTP/1.1
Host: www.rollege.com
Copy paste the request in the telnet session.
NOTE:
In windows telnet client, you will not able to see what you type. Cut paste the request and press enter 2 times.

GET method is used for requesting a web page. Other methods than can be used are POST and HEAD.

POST is used when user has to submits a form. Where as HEAD method ask server only to return the response header. 

The path is the part of the URL after the host name. This path is also called the request Uniform Resource Identifier (URI).

HTTP/1.1 is the HTTP version.

5> HTTP response
HTTP response Header
If the HTTP request is sent corectly you will get HTTP response something like this

Nesting divs within containers is a very easy concept, yet it‚Äôs also easy to overlook.
 Just remember; when beginning a new area that will contain subsequent divs, you will need to use a row to ensure proper alignment. The use of rows provides for a rather brilliant alternative to the standard practice of using ‚ÄúAlpha‚Äù and ‚ÄúOmega‚Äù classes when designing within a grid.
I am using simple_format(@company.description) to make a text into a number of paragraphs. On one page I only want to show, lets say, the first three paragraphs. Is there any nifty ruby method that can help out here or should I read up on my regular expression skills, which are very out of date.

What happens when you enter a URL in adressbar?

<br/>

This is what exactly happens

<img src=''/webserver.jpg''/>

1)When we enter a URL in addressbar, Web Browser sends a DNS query request to DNS server for domain to IP resolution.

 Suppose a user enters rollege.com in adressbar. Browser will send a query request to the DNS server ,to get the IP address of the server where the website is hosted.

2) In return to the query request, DNS server replies with the IP address of the website. 

3) After getting the IP address the browser genterates a HTTP request. This HTTP request contains the resource location(web pages,images,video) that the user wants to access from the server. This requests are automatically generated and send to the server by the browser. In the above image request to get index.php page is made to the server.

 This requests can be viewed using applications such as wireshark or fiddler.

4) In response to the HTTP request, web server respond with HTTP response message. Response message contains the requested resources.

5) Browser catch this response(HTML,CSS,javascript, images) and formulate it in the browser.

In fidler, use raw view to view both header and body(content) of a request.

<img src=''/fidler.jpg''/>

Generating a HTTP request manually through telnet

1> Open command prompt
 start > run > cmd

2> Enter the command
 telnet www.rollege.com 80
The command connect you to the server on which rollege.com is hosted. As the server is Web server connection is made on port no 80	

NOTE:
By default, telnet is not activated in Windows 7. To activate telnet follow the process.

3> Creating a HTTP request

HTTP request Header
 GET /index.php HTTP/1.1
Host: www.rollege.com
Copy paste the request in the telnet session.
NOTE:
In windows telnet client, you will not able to see what you type. Cut paste the request and press enter 2 times.

GET method is used for requesting a web page. Other methods than can be used are POST and HEAD.

POST is used when user has to submits a form. Where as HEAD method ask server only to return the response header. 

The path is the part of the URL after the host name. This path is also called the request Uniform Resource Identifier (URI).

HTTP/1.1 is the HTTP version.

5> HTTP response
HTTP response Header
If the HTTP request is sent corectly you will get HTTP response something like this
 HTTP/1.1 200 OK

What happens when you enter a URL in adressbar?

<br/>

This is what exactly happens

<img src=''/webserver.jpg''/>

1)When we enter a URL in addressbar, Web Browser sends a DNS query request to DNS server for domain to IP resolution.

 Suppose a user enters rollege.com in adressbar. Browser will send a query request to the DNS server ,to get the IP address of the server where the website is hosted.

2) In return to the query request, DNS server replies with the IP address of the website. 

3) After getting the IP address the browser genterates a HTTP request. This HTTP request contains the resource location(web pages,images,video) that the user wants to access from the server. This requests are automatically generated and send to the server by the browser. In the above image request to get index.php page is made to the server.

 This requests can be viewed using applications such as wireshark or fiddler.

4) In response to the HTTP request, web server respond with HTTP response message. Response message contains the requested resources.

5) Browser catch this response(HTML,CSS,javascript, images) and formulate it in the browser.

In fidler, use raw view to view both header and body(content) of a request.

<img src=''/fidler.jpg''/>

Generating a HTTP request manually through telnet

1> Open command prompt
 start > run > cmd

2> Enter the command
 telnet www.rollege.com 80
The command connect you to the server on which rollege.com is hosted. As the server is Web server connection is made on port no 80	

NOTE:
By default, telnet is not activated in Windows 7. To activate telnet follow the process.

3> Creating a HTTP request

HTTP request Header
 GET /index.php HTTP/1.1
Host: www.rollege.com
Copy paste the request in the telnet session.
NOTE:
In windows telnet client, you will not able to see what you type. Cut paste the request and press enter 2 times.

GET method is used for requesting a web page. Other methods than can be used are POST and HEAD.

POST is used when user has to submits a form. Where as HEAD method ask server only to return the response header. 

The path is the part of the URL after the host name. This path is also called the request Uniform Resource Identifier (URI).

HTTP/1.1 is the HTTP version.

5> HTTP response
HTTP response Header
If the HTTP request is sent corectly you will get HTTP response something like this

What happens when you enter a URL in adressbar?

<br/>

This is what exactly happens

<img src=''/webserver.jpg''/>

1)When we enter a URL in addressbar, Web Browser sends a DNS query request to DNS server for domain to IP resolution.

 Suppose a user enters rollege.com in adressbar. Browser will send a query request to the DNS server ,to get the IP address of the server where the website is hosted.

2) In return to the query request, DNS server replies with the IP address of the website. 

3) After getting the IP address the browser genterates a HTTP request. This HTTP request contains the resource location(web pages,images,video) that the user wants to access from the server. This requests are automatically generated and send to the server by the browser. In the above image request to get index.php page is made to the server.

 This requests can be viewed using applications such as wireshark or fiddler.

4) In response to the HTTP request, web server respond with HTTP response message. Response message contains the requested resources.

5) Browser catch this response(HTML,CSS,javascript, images) and formulate it in the browser.

In fidler, use raw view to view both header and body(content) of a request.

<img src=''/fidler.jpg''/>

Generating a HTTP request manually through telnet

1> Open command prompt
 start > run > cmd

2> Enter the command
 telnet www.rollege.com 80
The command connect you to the server on which rollege.com is hosted. As the server is Web server connection is made on port no 80	

NOTE:
By default, telnet is not activated in Windows 7. To activate telnet follow the process.

3> Creating a HTTP request

HTTP request Header
 GET /index.php HTTP/1.1
Host: www.rollege.com
Copy paste the request in the telnet session.
NOTE:
In windows telnet client, you will not able to see what you type. Cut paste the request and press enter 2 times.

GET method is used for requesting a web page. Other methods than can be used are POST and HEAD.

POST is used when user has to submits a form. Where as HEAD method ask server only to return the response header. 

The path is the part of the URL after the host name. This path is also called the request Uniform Resource Identifier (URI).

HTTP/1.1 is the HTTP version.

5> HTTP response
HTTP response Header
If the HTTP request is sent corectly you will get HTTP response something like this
 HTTP/1.1 200 OK

It creates a controller for posts called posts_controller.rb and a model called post.rb (note, not plural). It also creates a sub-folder in the views folder called posts. This contains four files, index.html.erb, edit.html.erb, show.html.erb, new.html.erb. You also may have noticed that we have specified the fields that are required i.e. title and body in addition to their their types ‚Äústring‚Äù and ‚Äútext‚Äù, respectively.\r\n\r\nCreating Comments using Scaffolding \r\nSimilarly, to create the relevant scaffold for comments, run this command: \r\n\r\n\r\n> ruby script/generate scaffold comment name:string body:text post:references\r\nAt the end of this command, you might have noticed the text ‚Äúpost:references‚Äù. This will be used to create the foreign key field for linking to the primary key of the posts table.\r\n\r\nRelating the Post and Comment Models \r\nNow that you have two models you need to create a relational link between them. To do this, you need to add a line of code to both the post and comment models, as follows: \r\n\r\n\r\npost.rb \r\nclass Post < ActiveRecord::Base \r\nhas_many :comments \r\nend \r\n\r\n\r\ncomment.rb \r\nclass Comment < ActiveRecord::Base \r\nbelongs_to :post\r\nend \r\n\r\nThis makes it really easy to find associated records. You will see how easy later when we need to display comments, which are related to a given post.\r\n\r\nHow do I create the Database and Tables? \r\nNow that you have created the models, you need to create the database then create tables to hold information about posts and comments.\r\n\r\nTo create the database you need to add the username and password into database.yml file, similar to below. \r\n\r\n\r\ndevelopment: \r\nadapter: mysql \r\nencoding: utf8 \r\nreconnect: false \r\ndatabase: myblog_development \r\npool: 5 \r\nusername: root\r\npassword: yourrootpassword \r\nhost: localhost \r\n\r\nAfter you have modified the database.yml file with your database logon details, you need to run the following rake commend from a command prompt. Also, be sure to set your current directory to the project folder first:\r\n\r\n> cd myblog \r\n> rake db:create \r\nThe database should now be created.\r\n\r\nDatabase Migration \r\nIn Rails, a Migration is the name given to the process of moving your database from one state to another. Some examples of migrating your database from one state to another are:\r\n\r\nCreating tables \r\nRemoving tables \r\nAdding new fields \r\nRemoving fields \r\nWhen you created the two models for posts and comments using scaffold, several files were created automatically. In particular, migration files were created in the db\\migrate folder. These files are used to create the tables for the post and comment models. To build the tables using the migration files you should run the following command:\r\n\r\n> rake db:migrate \r\nThe ‚Äúposts‚Äù and ‚Äúcomments‚Äù tables should now be created.\r\n\r\nLet‚Äôs See How Things Look! \r\nOk, lets fire up Webrick, Rails built-in web server, and see how things look.\r\n\r\n> ruby script/server \r\nNow browse to http://localhost:3000/posts on your favourite browser and you should see a screen that resembles the below screenshot. By default this URL request forwards control to the ‚Äúindex‚Äù method in the posts controller, then the ‚Äúindex.html.erb‚Äù view is rendered.

It creates a controller for posts called posts_controller.rb and a model called post.rb (note, not plural). It also creates a sub-folder in the views folder called posts. This contains four files, index.html.erb, edit.html.erb, show.html.erb, new.html.erb. You also may have noticed that we have specified the fields that are required i.e. title and body in addition to their their types ‚Äústring‚Äù and ‚Äútext‚Äù, respectively.\r\n\r\nCreating Comments using Scaffolding \r\nSimilarly, to create the relevant scaffold for comments, run this command: \r\n\r\n\r\n> ruby script/generate scaffold comment name:string body:text post:references\r\nAt the end of this command, you might have noticed the text ‚Äúpost:references‚Äù. This will be used to create the foreign key field for linking to the primary key of the posts table.\r\n\r\nRelating the Post and Comment Models \r\nNow that you have two models you need to create a relational link between them. To do this, you need to add a line of code to both the post and comment models, as follows: \r\n\r\n\r\npost.rb \r\nclass Post < ActiveRecord::Base \r\nhas_many :comments \r\nend \r\n\r\n\r\ncomment.rb \r\nclass Comment < ActiveRecord::Base \r\nbelongs_to :post\r\nend \r\n\r\nThis makes it really easy to find associated records. You will see how easy later when we need to display comments, which are related to a given post.\r\n\r\nHow do I create the Database and Tables? \r\nNow that you have created the models, you need to create the database then create tables to hold information about posts and comments.\r\n\r\nTo create the database you need to add the username and password into database.yml file, similar to below. \r\n\r\n\r\ndevelopment: \r\nadapter: mysql \r\nencoding: utf8 \r\nreconnect: false \r\ndatabase: myblog_development \r\npool: 5 \r\nusername: root\r\npassword: yourrootpassword \r\nhost: localhost \r\n\r\nAfter you have modified the database.yml file with your database logon details, you need to run the following rake commend from a command prompt. Also, be sure to set your current directory to the project folder first:\r\n\r\n> cd myblog \r\n> rake db:create \r\nThe database should now be created.\r\n\r\nDatabase Migration \r\nIn Rails, a Migration is the name given to the process of moving your database from one state to another. Some examples of migrating your database from one state to another are:\r\n\r\nCreating tables \r\nRemoving tables \r\nAdding new fields \r\nRemoving fields \r\nWhen you created the two models for posts and comments using scaffold, several files were created automatically. In particular, migration files were created in the db\\migrate folder. These files are used to create the tables for the post and comment models. To build the tables using the migration files you should run the following command:\r\n\r\n> rake db:migrate \r\nThe ‚Äúposts‚Äù and ‚Äúcomments‚Äù tables should now be created.\r\n\r\nLet‚Äôs See How Things Look! \r\nOk, lets fire up Webrick, Rails built-in web server, and see how things look.\r\n\r\n> ruby script/server \r\nNow browse to http://localhost:3000/posts on your favourite browser and you should see a screen that resembles the below screenshot. By default this URL request forwards control to the ‚Äúindex‚Äù method in the posts controller, then the ‚Äúindex.html.erb‚Äù view is rendered.
